I completed the task according to the requirements, and the estimated time spent was approximately three hours.
I used the simplest architecture here because I don't see the point in complicating a simple project. It's also possible that you meant level generation or object spawning, but since that wasn't specified, it wasn't implemented. For any questions or comments,
